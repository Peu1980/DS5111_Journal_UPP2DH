## Module 1:
In Module 1 we learned how to set up GIT repository and AWS. I was familiar with GIT repositories as I used it before in the program. Also, I have used AWS in one of the prior class. However, this is the first time I am doing EC2 instances. I very much enjoyed working and learning to create makefile and `vim` commands.
