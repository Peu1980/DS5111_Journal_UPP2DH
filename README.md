## Module 1:
In Module 1, we learned how to set up GIT repository and AWS. I was familiar with GIT repositories as I used it before in the program. Also, I have used AWS in one of the prior class. However, this is the first time I am doing EC2 instances. I very much enjoyed working and learning to create makefile and `vim`, `make' commands to execute codes. Also, working in Windows system is not straigthforward as in Mac OS as I have to use Pytty program to connect to EC2 instances.

## Module 2:
In Module 2, we learned more into working with EC2. I learned how to use assert to check conditions, start learning pytest and pylint. Also learned how to create a directory structure for testing. Though it took me a while to get everything running in the lab Software Skills I, I enjoyed very much working on it.

## Module 3:
In Module 3, we learned how to use Windows command promt to log into EC2 instance and use `Tmux`. I was successfully able to open Jupyter notebook in EC2 via the SSH and `Tmux`.

## Module 4:
